Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship Task -1 

📊 Task 1: Data Visualization 📊

I delved into the captivating "World Development Indicators: Population Dynamics" dataset, accessible here. To analyze and visualize this wealth of information, I harnessed the capabilities of Google Colab, an environment seamlessly designed for coding, analysis, and data visualization (Google Colab Documentation).

🖥️ Tools Used:

Pandas: The powerhouse for efficient data manipulation and analysis (Pandas Documentation).
Matplotlib: Crafting versatile and customizable plots with ease (Matplotlib Documentation).
Seaborn: My go-to library for statistical data visualization (Seaborn Documentation).

📈 Visual Creations:
I'm thrilled to share that I've crafted two vibrant bar charts! One depicting the young percentage of the working population, and the other showcasing the old percentage. It's truly remarkable how these visualizations, guided by the comprehensive documentation, transform raw data into insightful and compelling visuals.
